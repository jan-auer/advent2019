# Advent of Code 2019

Solutions for [Advent of Code 2019] to teach myself Go.

The implementations are probably neither very efficient, nor minimal. Instead,
the goal is to try out certain patterns in Go and get a feeling for the
language. Parts are intentionally overengineered (also not knowing in which
direction the challenge evolves) to test their implications.

For a comprehensive list of resources and implementations, have a look at
[Awesome Advent of Code].
